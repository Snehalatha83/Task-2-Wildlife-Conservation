        <h1>Habitats</h1>
        <p>A habitat is the natural environment where an organism lives and grows, and includes all the resources, living and physical, in that area. Habitats provide organisms with food, water, shelter, and space to survive. 
            There are many different types of habitats, including:
            Aquatic habitats
            These habitats include freshwater, marine water, and brackish water. They are home to many different types of animals, including amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, mammals, and birds. 
            Terrestrial habitats
            These habitats include forests, grasslands, steppes, and deserts. 
            Deserts
            Deserts are habitats that receive no more than 20 inches of precipitation per year. They can be hot or cold, and desert plants and animals are able to live with little water. 
            Marine habitats
            These habitats include the open sea, estuaries, bays, the intertidal zone, the sea bed, reefs, and deep and shallow water zones. 
            Habitats are made up of both biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors are living things, while abiotic factors are nonliving things.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Habitats</h2>
            <p>Habitats are important for many reasons, including:
                Supporting ecosystems: Healthy habitats provide food, water, and shelter for plants and animals, which helps maintain biodiversity and keep ecosystems in balance. 
                Improving quality of life: Habitats filter the air and water, which helps improve the quality of life for all living things. 
                Protecting from storms and flooding: Healthy habitats help protect us from storms and flooding. 
                Supporting industries: Habitats support industries like boating, fishing, and tourism. 
                Providing a place to relax: Habitats provide a place to relax and enjoy the outdoors. 
                Maintaining ecosystem services: Restoring habitats helps maintain ecosystem services, like clean air and water, pollination, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling. </p>
            <p>Habitats are the natural environments where wildlife thrives. Preserving them is crucial to maintaining the diversity and health of ecosystems.</p>
